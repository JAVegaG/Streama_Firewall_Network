# **Firewall + Streama + Shell + IVR**

This project consists of 3 parts:

- Implement a network architecture composed of a _**firewall server**_ and a _**Streaming server**_ using _Streama_.
- Implement **provision** files using _Shell_ that allow the automatic development of what was done in the previous point.
- Implement an **IVR** (Interactive Voice Response) in _FreePBX_ and analyze the behavior of the protocols in different scenarios using _Wireshark_.
